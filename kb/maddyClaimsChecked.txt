Other times they drift into a deep public swoon for the president that seems to directly contradict their previous criticism."  Check back here for frequent updates on the speech, including real-time fact-checking and analysis of what the president says on key issues like the economy, national security and infrastructure.',

 'snippet': " There are some easy lessons here. First, low unemployment is a low-income worker's best friend. Second, in the last two years, minimum-wage hikes raised income for the poor without, it seems, destroying jobs or raising the unemployment rate. Third, the U.S. economy seems capable of producing broadly shared income growth, at least late into a recovery cycle, despite the many well-founded fears that rich, educated workers are leaving their poorer, less-educated peers in the dust.  What nobody can say, however, is whether this happy trend is durable. Will a recession strike and wipe out these gains for the poor? Will minimum-wage increases prove to be a one-off moment of income growth for the poor? Will higher wages for low-skill workers ultimately accelerate the automation of their jobs, since employers get more labor savings from replacing an expensive job than a cheap one?  Nobody knows. But for now, wage growth for the poor is the happiest story nobody is talking about.  We want to hear what you think. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.",
