 'snippet': ' So that\'s about as bullish as it gets. Wages are rising and, importantly, not just for those with technical skills but also workers at the low end of the pay scale.  A wonky economic idea called the "marginal propensity to consume" is more or less behind why lowest-earning workers getting raises is good. MPC basically says that someone who goes from making $11 to $12 an hour is more likely than someone going from $25 to $26 an hour to spend that additional $1/hour of income, which for an economy largely based on consumer spending is good.',

During the 2016 campaign, Trump used to claim a Four-Pinocchio statistic that 58 percent of African-American youth was unemployed. The official Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate for black youth at the time was 19.2 percent -- about one-third of the rate used by Trump. Now that he\'s president, Trump appears all too happy to cite the unemployment rate for African Americans, bragging that it\'s the best since the turn of the century.',

Prior to the TCJA, the taxpayer who was eligible to claim the child\'s dependent exemption was also the one eligible to claim the CTC.

"The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history.
